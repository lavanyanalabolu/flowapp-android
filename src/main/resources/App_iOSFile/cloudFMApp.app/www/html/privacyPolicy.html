	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Services Which This Policy Covers:</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>This policy applies in full, across all CloudFM Group

	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Collection and Use of Personal Information:</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>CloudFM Group, and its associated companies, collects
	information through its web-based and mobile applications for the purposes of
	performing facilities management sevices. This information enables Cloud FM
	Group identify the client, location and the particular service to be performed,
	and to provide information to the contractor engaged in carrying out the
	services to enable the job/service to be completed satisfactorily. Without this
	information being captured and shared it would be difficult to provide
	effective services to our clients, however, in line with Data Protection Act
	principles, we capture only that information which is necessary for performing
	facilities management services.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>When you register with CloudFM, and in the course of
	working with CloudFM and its clients, we will capture and use the following
	information:</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Your mobile phone number</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Secure password (for accessing CloudFM services)</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Engineer / Contractor name</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Your photo (where you have chosen to share this with
	us)</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Company name/details (for billing purposes)</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Location (via your phone's GPS system) to help
	pinpoint the job and guide you to your location</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>- Details of jobs you have undertaken for CloudFM Group
	(eg client, location, equipment, service performed, completions, certifications
	etc)</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>We will store this information securely in our systems,
	and use it only for the purposes of providing facilities management services to
	our clients, and/or making contact with you about the particular jobs/services
	you are performing for us. We have protocols in place to ensure that
	identifiable information is not readily accessible, and use anonymous codes
	within our system to link activities together to prevent inadvertent
	identification.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Opt-Out Arrangements:</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>You do not have to share all of these details with us,
	as we provide telephone based helpdesk services, but it will limit your ability
	to work effectively with CloudFM Group and its associated companies if this
	information is not shared.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>Within our mobile App, there is also the facility to
	turn off location services when you are not engaged in CloudFM activities.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>If you do not wish your information to be held in our
	secure systems, then please write to CloudFM and we will arrange for your data
	to be removed from our systems (in line with the records retention requirements
	set out later in this policy statement). Opting out will remove your ability to
	use the mobile-App, and online CloudFM services.</span></p>

	we will archive the information collected during your work with us. Whilst this
	information will not be available online, we do need to keep this information
	in archive form, to fulfill our statutory regulations. In line with standard
	accounting practice and HRMC regulations our standard record retention policy
	for these purposes is 6 years.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Cookies and Other Technologies:</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>As with other providers of web-based services, we
	sometimes use Cookies and other information to help us better understand
	interactions with our website and online services. We do not track personal
	identity information through this technique, although information such as IP

	of this policy are treated as personal information which you can opt-out of
	being collected by disabling Cookies in your browser.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Disclosure to Third Parties</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>During the course of using our online / mobile services,
	some location information may need to be shared with web-based mapping services
	such as Google Maps, however this is only for the purposes of plotting your
	current (or the client/jobs) location, and will not identify you personally to
	those other services, and no information is retained after the service
	completes / website / application is closed.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>We do not share your information with other companies,
	eg for the purpose of marketing, advertising or contacting you, unless you have
	explicitly consented for us to do so, via "Opt-In" or "Share" functionality
	within our online and mobile services. If you have opted in, or chosen to share
	information, you can of course opt-out at any time, using the same online /
	mobile service to do so.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>We may however need to disclose information when
	required to do so formally by Police or other security services as part of
	criminal investigation, litigation or similar, or to other government bodies as
	part regulation or legislative requirements.</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><b><span>Client / Contractor Responsibilities</span></b></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>Protecting information securely depends upon the
	cooperation of both clients and contractors in not disclosing secure /
	confidential information to any third party. Where CloudFM Group identifies
	insecure behaviours then it reserves the right to withdraw CloudFM Group and
	associated company services immediately.</span></p>

	overall service to the customer.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p style='text-align:left'><span>Updates to the software will
